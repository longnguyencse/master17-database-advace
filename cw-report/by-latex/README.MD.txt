Data analysis using hadoop MapReduce environment

This project deals with analysis of YouTube data using Hadoop MapReduce framework on a cloud platform AWS. Hadoop multi node cluster is setup on private cloud called AWS (Amazon Web Services). Within AWS, I have set up EC2 instances with one name node and 5 data nodes. The video statistics obtained from the API is stored into the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and the data processing is done by the MapReduce system.
